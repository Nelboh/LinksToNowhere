# This website does not actually exist.

I'm experimenting with SVG backgrounds and patterns, so I thought I'd make at least one website to see how they behave. 

Also, designing web pages is fun. :D

## Things to work on

Despite the extremely fancy SVG background (kudos to [these clever people](https://www.svgbackgrounds.com/) for that one), I wanted to go for a more minimalist look overall, since my default setting seems to be div overload. I managed to cut the number of divs by a lot, but there could probably still be a div cull without too many major side-effects.

Currently, the contact section reorders itself on mobile using display order, but I understand that's not wonderful in terms of accessibility. Definitely something to revisit in the future.
